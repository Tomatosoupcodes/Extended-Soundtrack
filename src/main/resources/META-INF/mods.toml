This mod adds all C418's unused music from Volume Alpha and Beta into the game. Some tracks have been slightly edited for ingame.
A full list of where every song plays is available in the README and on the mod's Forge page.

Note: I do not own any of this music. 
All music belongs to Daniel Rosenfeld, aka C418, and I am complient with any requests he has for this mod to be removed. 

C418 makes great music, and if you want to know more, here are some links: 
Check him out here: https://c418.org
