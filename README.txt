This text document lays out the description, installation, and other specifics of the Minecraft Extended Soundtrack mod.

==============
I. DESCRIPTION
==============

This mod adds every single unused track from C418's albums Minecraft Volume Alpha and Minecraft Volume Beta.

Here is a full list of tracks and where each plays in the game:

C418 - Door: Creative Mode

C418 - Death: Music Disc

C418 - Moog City: Creative Mode

C418 - Équinoxe: Survival Mode

C418 - Chris: Survival Mode

C418 - Excuse: Nether

C418 - Dog: Music Disc

C418 - Beginning: Creative Mode

C418 - Droopy Likes Ricochet: Music Disc

C418 - Droopy Likes Your Face: Music Disc

C418 - Ki: Nether

C418 - Flake: Music Disc

C418 - Kyoto: Music Disc

C418 - Eleven: Music Disc

C418 - Intro: Nether

Please note that Disc 11 can also now be repaired with one Ender Pearl and a slime ball,
producing Disc Eleven (a little confusing, I know.)

II. Installation
================

This mod is installed like any other mod, but if you need help, here are the instructions:

1. Go to your .minecraft folder (Windows) or minecraft Folder (Linux/Mac). In Windows, if you've never
opened your .minecraft folder, you have to press Windows Key + R, and type the following in the Run Box: %appdata%\.minecraft

2. In the .minecraft folder, check if there is a "mods" folder. If not, create one. Next, put the mod JAR into the folder. 

3. Run Forge: Simply run Forge from the Minecraft Launcher, and the mod should show up!

If this doesn't work, you can check other guides for your operating system.
